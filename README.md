Rope
====

Rope is a public Kite registry with proxy support between kites. Also introduces bi-directional communication between Kites.

Getting Started
---------------

Before starting make sure to call `npm install` and `go get github.com/koding/kite` if you want to try go example. Then to start Rope server;

```
 $ node rope.js
```

This will start the server on `0.0.0.0:8080` which then you can run one of the node examples (in another terminal session);

```
 $ node rope-node.js
```

will create a Rope Node with Node.js, same file also supports browsers which you can try it out;

```
 $ open rope-browser.html
```

will load the `kite.js` bundle and then runs the `rope-node.js` which will create another Rope Node in the browser this time.
To try another Rope Node in Go this time;

```
 $ go run rope-node.go
```

Which will do the same with others.

Once ready, you can start playing with nodes by calling `run` over `Rope Server`. The best way to do that for now opening Dev Console in your choice of Browser after loading the `rope-browser.html`. Which will connect to `Rope Server`, identifies itself and will get a list of Kites registered before which you can access from `publicKites` global variable. There will be another public variable called `kite` which will allow you to interact with `Rope Server`. And for an example of usage of `run` over `Rope Server` would be (in Dev Console of rope-browser.html);

## `kite.ping`

```
 > kite.tell('run', {kiteId: publicKites[0], method: "kite.ping"}).then(console.log.bind(console))
 pong
```
will ping the first public kite which will end with a simple `pong`


## `kite.systemInfo`

```
 > kite.tell('run', {kiteId: publicKites[0], method: "kite.systemInfo"}).then(console.log.bind(console))
 {
   diskTotal: 975902848,
   diskUsage: 328007624,
   homeDir: "/Users/gokmen",
   memoryUsage: 12602589184,
   state: "RUNNING",
   totalMemoryLimit: 17179869184,
   uname: "darwin",
 }
```
will return the system info from first public kite.


## `kite.prompt`

```
 > kite.tell('run', {kiteId: publicKites[0], method: "kite.prompt", args: ["Your Name? "]}).then(console.log.bind(console))

 # on the terminal of first public kite you will see the prompt "Your Name? "
